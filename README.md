This is a semple CMS that uses the PHP CodeIgniter framework.
After you login you come to dashboard when you can create some articles, catogories and new users.
Then you can publish articles, unpublish and so on...
I have included a database dump file as well. Just import it via Phpmyadmin.
go to:  localhoust/gkcms/index.php/admin/provera/login

have fun!
