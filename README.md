This is a sample CMS that uses the PHP CodeIgniter framework.
After you login you come to dashboard when you can create some articles, categories, users, upload images...
Then you can publish articles, unpublish and so on...
I have included a database dump file as well, just import it via Phpmyadmin
and go to: localhoust/gkcms/index.php/admin/provera/login
then login with this username: gkaran and password: 12345
